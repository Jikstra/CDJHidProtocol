= Library interaction

This Page contains contains documentation for the simple IO protocol used to
control the LEDs on the CDJ or detecting whether the user
interacted with a physical control (such as buttons, knobs, etc).

Communication in both directions uses a simple header with types `0x20` (input)
or `0x21` (output).
Both packets contain a single structure with fixed offsets (similar to 
the structure of packets exchanged by simpler HID controllers). Since the
information is very tightly packed, a bytefield diagram is not able to describe
the structure in enough detail, thus it will be described in table form. This
table has a Column `Bytes` which identifies the position of the Byte or Bytes
in question from the very start of the message. Moreover, the Column `Mask`
contains a Mask (or an expression evaluating to mask) to be applied to the
current Byte(s) to identify the exact
Bit(s) in question. `Control` will hold the label of the control seen on the CDJ
or an otherwise descriptive name in case the label isn't present, while
`Notes` will contain further explanation on the current Control
in case that's required. `Type` indicates the physical type of control.

== CDJ->Host
The Host seems to poll control messages from the host roughly every 100ms
(TODO: seems low, need verification).
When the `Type` describes a button, the bit being set means that the Button
is currently being pressed while an unset bit indicates the opposite.
All bytes that express values within a range are generally mapped linearly
to their physical control.

NOTE: the Jog Adjust Control as well as presses of the Shortcut Button do 
not get reported by the CDJ.

== Host->CDJ

It has been observed that Rekordbox sends these control packets roughly every
10ms but larger intervals should also work. However, that would affect output
latency and the display quality of "high resolution sections" such as the Time 
Elapsed/Remaining and LCD of the Jog Wheel.

.Types
SC-LED:: Single Color LED
Enum:: See the attached List of Key-Value pairs (Keys being Integers)
Boolean:: Similar to *SC-LED* but causes a change on the Display instead of changing an LED

Byte:: Single Byte usually representing Integer value
uShortLE:: 16-bit unsigned Integer serialized in little-endian byte-order. Generally controls some onscreen element

=== Time-Struct

Whenever the CDJ has to transmit a relative amount of time, it serializes the
time information into the following four bytes:

[bytefield]
----
include::example$bitfield.edn[]

(draw-box "minutes" {:span 8})
(draw-box "seconds" {:span 8})
(draw-box "milliseconds LSB" {:span 8})
(draw-box "milliseconds MSB" {:span 8})
----

NOTE: judging from the traffic observed between the host and the CDJ, these
fields are unsigned and thus, cannot contain unsigned values. However, this
hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. TODO

Minutes:: amount of minutes (integer)
Seconds:: amount of seconds in current minutes (so only carries values from
0 to 59)
Millseconds (LSB/MSB):: amount of milliseconds in current second. (serialized
as ushort LE)

Serializing time in this way limits the maximum track length a CDJ can deal with
via HID to roughly 4 hours and 20 minutes.

== TLDR

The previous sections can't really be shortened. However, for the sake of 
visualizing the packets, I will provide to bytefield-diagrams illustrating
the offsets of compound fields and unknown bits. Each cell contains a bitmask
expressed in hexadecimal to identify the bits whose functionality has not been
discovered yet.
