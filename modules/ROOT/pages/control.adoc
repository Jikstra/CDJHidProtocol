= Control Packets

== Controlling LEDs on the CDJ

Controlling LEDs on the CDJ can by accomplished by sending
packets with a <<startup.adoc#simple-header, simple header>>

include::example$common_header.edn[]


(draw-packet-header 0x21)

(draw-box nil [{:span 14} :box-above])
(draw-box "Controller control data" [ :box-middle {:span 16}])
(draw-box nil [:box-middle {:span 16}])
(draw-box nil [{:span 16} :box-below])

----

This type of packet seems to pack data very compact and encodes data
even into single bits
