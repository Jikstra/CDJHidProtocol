It is possible to send library data to the CDJ by directly sending strings to
the CDJ which are then displayed at their appropriate places. This is done by
using a <<startup.adoc#extended-header,extended header packet>> (to allow the
data to be fragmented over multiple packets). It follows a comparatively
simple format which allows to send strings to the nine library rows:

Each zone can be controlled using a row-struct:

[bytefield]
----
include::example$row_struct.edn[]

(row-struct "R" "I" #((draw-gap "UTF-16LE String")  (draw-bottom)))

----
`R` indicates the row number while `I` indicates an the ID of the optional Icon
(which the CDJ will prefix before the string)
as well as whether the row in question is currently selected.
The String is encoded as UTF-16LE and terminate with a null-byte (or rather two
`0x00` bytes since the string is encoded as UTF-16). The information in the `I`
byte stores whether the row in question is currently selected as well as the icon
ID in the following bitfield:

[bytefield]
----
include::partial$bitfield.edn[]
(create-bitfield-env)

(draw-box "S")
(draw-box "icon ID" {:span 7})
----

If the "S" bit is set, then that row is currently selected.

.Known Icon IDs
[options="header"]
|===
|   ID  | Icon | Description

| `0x00` |  --  | Don't prefix any Icon
| `0x02` | image:cdj_icons/close_folder.jpg[closed folder] image:cdj_icons/open_folder.jpg[closed folder] | Folder
| `0x04` | image:cdj_icons/track_file_name.jpg[track / filename] | Musical 8th Note (used to indicate entry is a track)
| `0x07` | image:cdj_icons/playlist.jpg[playlist icon] | Document / Playlist / Fallback
|===


These row-structs are then collected in a buffer and sent out using an
<<startup.adoc#extended-header,extended header packet>> (so you might have
to break up the buffer)

[bytefield]
----
include::example$common_fragmented_header.edn[]
include::example$row_struct.edn[]

(draw-packet-header 0x2a "I" "L")

(doseq [n (range 9)]
  (row-struct n "Icon" #(draw-box "String" {:span 2})))

(draw-padding 0x40)
